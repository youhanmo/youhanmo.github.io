<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hello, I am Hanmo You from Tianjin University. I am currently a 4th-year PhD student from  <a href='https://tjusail.github.io/'>WISE Lab</a>  at Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. Junjie Chen and Prof. Zan Wang.

My research interests include software testing, software engineering for AI, and AI for software engineering. During my PhD, I am currently focusing on protecting the safety of deep learning systems throughout their evolution.

I have always loved traveling around the world. During my undergraduate years, I went backpacking for an extended period to visit countries including Japan, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar. I have also traveled to the European continent, the African continent, and Oceania, and I am still looking forward to seeing more of the world.

P.S. I am scheduled to graduate in June 2026 and am seeking postdoctoral positions or research faculty roles (e.g., Assistant/Associate Professor) at colleges and universities. If you have an available position and are interested in my research, please do not hesitate to contact me. My Email: youhanmo {at} tju {dot} edu {dot} cn
